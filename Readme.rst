About the game
--------------

CarMechanic is an open source car mechanic simulator that allows you to disassembly/assembly cars.
This game is NOT finished as i would need a full car (including the engine) model to finish the game core.

Adding a new vehicle
--------------------

Notice:

- You will need Unity.
- Valid model formats: fbx or collada (.dae).
- Car parts can't have childs, so each part must be a single solid.
